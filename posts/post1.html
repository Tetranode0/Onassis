        <p>"On an autumn day,
             at the age of 27, soaked by the cold rain, 
             I realised I'd never love again." - Martín
            
        
    A world wherein ambiguity rules as principle, and sincerity is "cringe". These are backwards ideologies that dement the dating world.
Situationships, online dating, celibacy (yes, celibacy), sex 'positivity'. It's abiological. It's bitter. It's bleak. Let's discuss this.

The name of this article is intentional. Beyond the authors personal connection to Vietnam, or Da Lat rather, D'annam is a Vietnamese fragrance house,
'Vietnamese Coffee' is our analogy for modern romance.
Known for rich, bold... bitter flavour from the Robusta cofee bean, and oft paired with soft sweetness of condensed milk, we arrive to our name.

<br>Modern romance follows.

Digitalised courtship is fast-paced, short lived, and insincere. A jolt like espresso from Tinder likes.
Our digital culprits are: Hollywood, Social media, and therapy. <i>that</i> therapy.

In Hollywood, love inspires a reverent fear— known or unknown to its protagonists. To lose one's rationality and surrender to feeling.
Suddenly, fit or compatibility no longer matter. You don’t want the person who makes <i>sense</i> — you want <i>them</i>. 

This is unheard of historically... Why?

<blockquote class="freud-quote">
    "Woe to you, my princess, when I come.<br>
    I will kiss you quite red and feed you till you are plump.<br>
    And if you are forward you shall see who is the stronger,<br>
    a gentle little girl<br>
    who doesn't eat enough,<br>
    or a big wild man<br>
    who has cocaine in his body."
    <br>- Sigmund Freud, letter to his future wife, Marth
</blockquote>

Love, historically, was a utilitarian agreement. You choose the most reliable, sturdy partner you can. Someone to farm, fight, and make children alongside. A time of survival, not surrender.
Our "Romantic love", Hollywood love— is rare.
It is the abstraction of what YOU have individually been searching for, beyond ingrained bias.

<br>Heart-led love mirrors lust. It's irrational, deviant, sublime.
